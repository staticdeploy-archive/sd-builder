# sd-builder

Opinionated builder for react web projects.

## Usage

* `sd-builder dev` sets up dev environment with auto-recompiling
* `sd-builder build` builds the project
* `sd-builder config` writes the app configuration to `app-config.js`
* `sd-builder lint` lints files with eslint
* `sd-builder test` runs tests
* `sd-builder coverage` runs tests and calculates coverage
* `sd-builder deploy` build the project and write configuration to `app-config.js`

## Main conventions

### Html

* The builder expects there to be an `app/main.html` file, which is compiled
  into `build/index.html`. For now the compilation consists in a simple a
  copy/paste.

### JS

* The builder expects there to be an `app/main.jsx`Â file, which is used as
  `webpack`'s entry point. The generated bundle is written to
  `build/_assets/js/app.js`.

* Files are compiled by babel. It's up to the user to specify which plugins to
  use by installing and listing them in a `.babelrc` config file.

* npm modules listed in `deps.json`'s `js` array are separated from the main
  bundle and compiled into `build/_assets/js/vendor.js`.

* During `webpack`'s compilation `NODE_PATH` includes the `app` directory.

* It's possible to `require` / `import` `.js`, `.jsx` and `.json` files.

* Source maps are always generated.

### Assets

* The content of the folder `app/assets` will be recursively copied into
  `build/_assets`.

### CSS

* Files listed in `deps.json`'s `css` array are bundled (concat) into
  `build/_assets/css/vendor.css`.

### Fonts

* Files listed in `deps.json`'s `fonts` array are copied (concat) into
  `build/_assets/fonts`.

### Tests

* Test files go into the `test` directory. They can either have a `.js` or a
  `.jsx ` extension.

### Version

* the build generates a `VERSION` file with the following format:
  * if building in a git repository, `[package.json version] - [git commit sha]`
  * otherwise, `[package.json version]`

### General

* When `NODE_ENV=production` JS and CSS files are minified.

* Linting can be configured with a `.eslintrc` file.

## Configuration

Running `sd-builder config` a `build/app-config.js` file is generated, exporting
one global variable, `window.APP_CONFIG`, which is a map of key-value pairs
gathered from:

* the `.env` file when `NODE_ENV=development`
* environment variables prefixed by `__APP_CONFIG__` file when
  `NODE_ENV=production`

You should add `app-config.js` script in your `main.html` file.

```html
<script src="app-config.js"></script>
```

At build time, it's possible to distinguish between different execution environments by setting the EXEC_ENV build environment variable. EXEC_ENV defaults to browser.

```html
<!-- @if EXEC_ENV=='cordova' -->
<script src="/app-config.js"></script>
<script src="cordova.js"></script>
<script src="/_assets/js/vendor.js"></script>
<script src="/_assets/js/app.js"></script>
<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @if EXEC_ENV=='browser' -->
<script src="app-config.js"></script>
<script src="_assets/js/vendor.js"></script>
<script src="_assets/js/app.js"></script>
<!-- @endif -->
```
